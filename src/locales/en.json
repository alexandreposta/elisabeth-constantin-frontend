        "Once layered, these transparent strata create a tridimensional image suspended in space.",
        "<strong>Process and perception</strong><br/>The artwork becomes movement: it lives through the visitor's steps, through shadows, light, and transparency. Depending on the angle or lighting, lines shift, shapes appear or fade, and depth transforms.",
        "<strong>The intention</strong><br/>My practice aims to go beyond a fixed image. Every piece questions perception: it is both surface and volume, a living, ever-changing painting. It cannot be read from a single viewpoint — it reveals itself through a dialogue with the gaze."
